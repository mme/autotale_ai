INSTRUCTIONS = """### Instructions for Writing a Good Children's Story:

1. **Understand the Audience:**
   - **Age Range:** Define the target age group (e.g., 3-5 years, 6-8 years, 9-12 years). Adjust language, themes, and complexity to fit the developmental level of that age group.
   - **Vocabulary:** Use simple, accessible words for younger children (3-5 years), while slightly more complex and descriptive language can be used for older children (9-12 years).
   - **Sentence Structure:** Keep sentences shorter and more direct for younger audiences. For older children, vary sentence length and structure to make the story more engaging.

2. **Create Relatable, Likable Characters:**
   - **Protagonist:** Develop a central character who is relatable and reflects qualities that children can identify with, such as curiosity, kindness, bravery, or playfulness.
   - **Animal or Object Characters:** Many children's stories feature animals, toys, or everyday objects that come to life. These characters often embody exaggerated emotions and teach lessons.
   - **Sidekick/Friend Characters:** Introduce a sidekick or friend character to add humor, support, and interaction with the protagonist.

3. **Establish a Clear and Simple Plot:**
   - **Conflict or Problem:** Start with a simple problem or challenge that the main character needs to solve. It could be something relatable (e.g., learning to share, overcoming a fear) or magical (e.g., embarking on an adventure to find a hidden treasure).
   - **Adventure or Journey:** Many good children's stories involve a journey or adventure that leads the character to new discoveries.
   - **Resolution:** Ensure the conflict or problem is resolved by the end of the story. The resolution should leave the reader with a sense of satisfaction and possibly teach a lesson or moral.

4. **Infuse the Story with Imagination and Wonder:**
   - **Fantasy Elements:** Include elements of fantasy, magic, or whimsical scenarios (e.g., talking animals, imaginary lands, magical powers). Children's stories should inspire creativity and wonder.
   - **Humor:** Sprinkle lighthearted humor throughout the story. Physical comedy, funny dialogue, and silly situations resonate well with kids.
   - **Visual Imagery:** Use vivid and colorful descriptions to paint a clear picture in the child's mind. Consider how the story would look as illustrations.

5. **Include a Positive and Meaningful Message:**
   - **Moral or Lesson:** Incorporate a simple moral or lesson that children can take away. This could be about friendship, bravery, kindness, self-acceptance, or problem-solving.
   - **Emotionally Resonant:** Tap into emotions that children can understand—like fear of the dark, feeling lonely, or the joy of discovery. Make sure the protagonist learns and grows emotionally through the story.

6. **Keep the Pace Engaging:**
   - **Quick Start:** Jump right into the story without too much exposition. Children's attention spans can be short, so start with action or an intriguing situation.
   - **Exciting Moments:** Maintain interest with exciting moments, surprises, or twists, but keep them understandable for the age group.
   - **Consistent Flow:** Keep the story moving without long detours. Focus on key events that push the plot forward.

7. **Ensure the Ending is Satisfying and Uplifting:**
   - **Happy or Hopeful Endings:** Most children's stories end on a happy note. Even if there are challenges along the way, make sure the ending leaves the reader feeling good.
   - **Conclusion with a Takeaway:** The story should conclude with a clear takeaway—whether that's a life lesson, a happy realization, or simply a fun and imaginative ending.

8. **Make the Dialogue Engaging and Age-Appropriate:**
   - **Simple, Clear Dialogue:** Keep dialogue short and clear, especially for younger readers. Characters should speak in a way that is easy to follow but still full of personality.
   - **Express Emotion and Energy:** Use dialogue to express emotion, excitement, or humor. This helps characters come to life and keeps readers engaged.

9. **Use Rhythm and Repetition (for Younger Children):**
   - **Rhythmic Language:** For very young readers, consider using rhythmic language, rhyme, or repetition. This makes the story fun to listen to and easy to remember.
   - **Catchphrases or Refrains:** Introduce a catchphrase or repeating line that kids can recognize and anticipate. Repetition can create comfort and predictability in the story.

10. **Respect Children's Intelligence:**
    - **Avoid Preaching:** While it's important to have a message, avoid being overly preachy or moralistic. Let the lesson unfold naturally through the character's journey.
    - **Foster Curiosity:** Allow for some open-ended questions or wonder at the end to encourage further thinking and imagination.

### Additional Tips:
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Incorporate diverse characters and settings so children from different backgrounds can see themselves in the story. Ensure the story promotes inclusivity and respect for others.
- **Illustration-Friendly Descriptions:** Even if illustrations aren't included, write in a way that suggests visual scenes. This could make the story more engaging and imaginative.
- **Re-read and Simplify:** Once the story is complete, re-read it to ensure clarity and simplicity. Check for age-appropriateness and that the plot is easy to follow.
